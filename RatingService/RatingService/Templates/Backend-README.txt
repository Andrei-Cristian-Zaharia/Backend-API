I made this project in order to learn some stuff about backend and API's.

Tehnologies that I used for this project are:

- MongoDB;
- Azure Dev Ops;
- Visual Studio;
- Postman;
- Fork;

MongoDB:

This was used to store data online. I made for now 3 collections: Movie, Review and User.

Movie collection contains data about movies that are stored;
Review collection contains data about reviews that are stored;
User collection contains data about users that are stored;
